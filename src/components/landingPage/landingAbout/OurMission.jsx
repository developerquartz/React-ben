                  Offer in Compromise is a negotiation between the IRS and an
                  individual who struggles to pay their tax liability in full or
                  will experience financial hardship in doing so. This is also a
                  legitimate method to settle tax delinquencies for a reduced
                  amount. There are certain factors to consider such as income,
                  ability to pay, and asset equity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You must make the required tax returns and estimated payments
                  plus an application to ensure eligibility. You will also be
                  asked to complete Form 433-A for individuals or Form 433-B for
                  businesses and Form 656 in addition to the required documents.
                </p>

                  The first-time penalty abatement is the most commonly
                  available type of waiver allowed by the IRS. If you have a
                  good history of filing and paying taxes on time and you donâ€™t
                  have a record of penalties, you may be qualified for
                  first-time penalty abatement where the IRS waives the penalty.
