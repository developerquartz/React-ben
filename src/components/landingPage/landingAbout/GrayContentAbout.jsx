                  The first-time penalty abatement is the most commonly
                  available type of waiver allowed by the IRS. If you have a
                  good history of filing and paying taxes on time and you donâ€™t
                  have a record of penalties, you may be qualified for
                  first-time penalty abatement where the IRS waives the penalty.
